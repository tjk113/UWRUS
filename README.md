# Ukikipedia World Record Update Script (UWRUS)

Automatically pulls new X-Cam and Single Star world records from the (discord/spreadsheets) and updates it on the star's RTA Guide page

## Current functionality:
Can update a specified record on a specified page

## // TODO:

- Figure out if we're using a discord bot to watch the Usamune discord channels, or if we're going to pull data from the spreadsheets
- Figure out how exactly we're getting WR updates. On what schedule will the script run?
- Make a dictionary with some representation of a star name as the key, and the rta guide page title as the value
- For X-Cam records, make sure that we're pulling the record for the fastest RTA strat (unless otherwise specified)
