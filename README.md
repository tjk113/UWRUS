# Ukikipedia World Record Update Script (UWRUS)

Automatically updates RTA and Single Star world records on [Ukikipedia's RTA Guide](https://ukikipedia.net/wiki/RTA_Guide).

## Current functionality:
Mostly operational(?)

## // TODO:
- Continue fixing bugs as they are discovered 🐜
- Figure out where this will be hosted
- Someday stop the inevitable tide that sulks unto this
codebase, continually making it less readable and more
confusing to even its sole author
